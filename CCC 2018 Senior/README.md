Contest can be found at: https://cemc.math.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2018/stage%201/seniorEF.pdf

Problems:
 - Problem S1: Voronoi Villages (15/15)

 - Problem J4/S2: Sunflowers (15/15)

 - Problem S3: RoboThieves (15/15 with Python2 and 10/15 with Python3)

Notes:
 - My S3 looks really messy (use y,x instead of x,y and bad commenting) because of the debugging/rushing
 - The majority of the time was spent making S3 not TLE in Python
