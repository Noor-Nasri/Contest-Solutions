Within a three hour period on July/24/2018 I finished s1-s3.
Problem S1: Voronoi Villages (15/15)
Problem J4/S2: Sunflowers (15/15)
Problem S3: RoboThieves (15/15 with Python2 and 10/15 with Python3)

Notes:
 - Bad comments in S3 because I did not have much time left when I finished it
 - The majority of the time was spent making S3 not TLE in Python
